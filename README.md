# SuperSpaceScroller
A simple side scrolling game written in C, as a class project, dodge the Xs and collect the Os, save your highscore. 

Thanks for looking at my project! 

Everything is very simple, there are instuctions within the game. Feel free to steal the source code and improve or modify.
Hopefully, I can get around to making a video demonstration and modding tutorial soon. I will continue updating and making
improvements when I can. Still getting through school first. 

The .exe is the precompiled version, should be functional on any WIndows box. The source code is also available for those who
(intelligently) don't run random execuatables from the internet. 

This project was written using VS2022, and the built in compiler. Works on Windows 10/11, other OS compatabilities are not
guaranteed. 

Brownie points to whoever can fix screen flickering issues consistently. Sometimes the gameplay is smooth, sometimes it isn't.

This was written for ITT - 310 at Grand Canyon University, for Professor Farris. Thanks for teaching us C!
